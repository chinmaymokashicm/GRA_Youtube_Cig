"Katherine Heigl & David Letterman vape electronic cigarettes","https://youtube.com/watch?v=ysGyfLwwr1s","http://www.CanadaVapes.com

Katherine Higl appears on David Letterman and discusses the electronic cigarette, and how it has helped her stop smoking.

Katherine started smoking at the age of 25.  She had tried all of the traditional methods to quit smoking, including Chatax, patches and gums.  She proceeds to pull out her electronic cigarette, and explains how it works.  She explains she vapes liquid nicotine that is vaporied by the atomizer.  

David Letterman then takes a few puffs of the e-cigarette.  He blows some smoke rings, and states ""This is remarkable"".  Then he states ""this outta get it done my friend"".

Katherine states she has read that nicotine by inself isn't any more harmefull to you then caffeene.  With no second hand smoke, Katherine Heigl loves her new personal vaporizer.

Canadians can get a wealth of information on the electronic cigarette, and purchase a starter e-cigarette kit at:

"Cresco Disposable Cannabis Vape Pen “Friyay” Edition :  Cannabis Product Review","https://youtube.com/watch?v=80q0vTpW83k","Cresco Friyay Vape Pen -- this disposable 300mg THC vape pen from Cresco is WONDERFUL.  I honestly have never tasted anything like this before! Ever! 

The vape is fairly high THC with 79%THC and I can expect to get about 100 3-second inhales out of this pen.  There are no buttons or things to plug in -- super simple.  Just inhale, that's it.  

The TASTE is what's out of this world -- the package just says “Friyay”, so I assume it’s probably a blend of a few different strains.  To me, it's like a Hollister perfume that I used to have! It's like Apple Shampoo to me, very clean, light, and somewhat fruity.  Truly a unique taste that reminds me of driving around in a car or being on a Ferris wheel LOL

"Why I'm Quitting Vaping!!! - No Nicotine November","https://youtube.com/watch?v=6sFN-MmDXLY","I started vaping in February of this year on accident, I had no plans of developing a ridiculous addiction to nicotine and disposable vapes. In fact, I constantly made fun of my friends for things like Juuls, But here in front of me are the majority of the vapes I've gone through in these last eight months, which when I see all of these together it's pretty embarrassing (laugh) because there is still easily 10-20 that are missing. This November I'm starting a month-long attempt to quit Vaping with the Title of No Nicotine November. In today's video, I want to cover the most important part of quitting something like nicotine: understanding why you want to quit.

"How to setup your Vape Pen?","https://youtube.com/watch?v=s0MrPcALhu8","So you've received a new vape pen.
In this video we’ll show you the steps to set it up and have it working 

Step 1: Charge Your device - your vape pen comes with an inbuilt battery and will have some charge, but we recommended charging for 2-3 hours before using the kit.
 
Step 2: Check your coil. It’s important to make sure the coil has been fully tightened before you fill up the tank or pod with liquid. If it’s loose your liquid will leak through the air holes. 

Step 3: Prime your coils. We recommend adding a few drops of liquid to your coils before filling up the tank or pod. This allows the liquid to soak into the cotton and helps avoid a dry hit or burnt taste when you first use your vape. 

Step 4: Add your liquid and let it steep for 2-3 minutes. Steeping lets your liquid soak fully into the cotton and will also help prevent burning the cotton in your coil.

Step 5: Turn on your device. It might sound basic, however sometimes users can find this tricky. 5 rapid clicks to the fire button will power your device on.

Before you go blowing clouds follow the following tips for the best experience:

If you’re vaping mouth to lung (with a coil of 1.0 ohm and over) then we would recommend using a 50:50 liquid. This is a thinner liquid that requires less heat to vapourise.

However If you are using a sub-ohm device (a coil of 1.0 ohm and under) you need a thicker liquid. We would recommend a 70:30 ratio as the device is more powerful. If you use a 50:50 liquid in a sub-ohm device it is highly likely the device will leak and cause your coil to burn. 

Bare in mind Most coils will last between 5-7 days before you need to replace them. You will know when to change them as you will begin to lose flavour and you will start to get a burnt taste. 

Now, you should be ready to vape.

"Review & Unboxing of the ZKTLZ Cannabis Vape Pen by Redecann","https://youtube.com/watch?v=Txmj1l2EJ_g","In this episode I review and unbox my first legal cannabis vape pen. I purchased the ZKTLZ flavour Redecann Redee Pen from Nova Cannabis on Queen ST W in Toronto, Canada on February 11th 2020 for $55 before tax.

Some corrections -

1.4 grams is the equivalent of 350 mg of extract.
There is french on the label but no french on the user instructions.

Flavors are absolutely crucial in helping adults to quit the deadly habit of smoking cigarettes. Hey government bureaucrats: Believe it or not, adults like flavors, too!

"3 Pros and 3 Cons of Using Vape Pens to Smoke Marijuana","https://youtube.com/watch?v=DPI5T6HcYTE","Every marijuana consumer has his or her preferred way of ingesting cannabis whether is be a joint, pipe, bong, vape, or edible. Vape pens are a portable and popular way to consume marijuana, so much so that some users prefer vape pens over any other method of consumption. This form of ingesting marijuana is becoming more common among users because they look just like pens, so they’re easy to transport and use. Consumers can simply keep their pens in their pockets and vape on the go whenever they please. This simplicity and portability isn’t without a glitch though, because like every other smoking method, vape pens have both pros and cons. 

First, vape pens are a favorite among users because there is no combustion. The flower or oil that is inhaled doesn’t burn, so users don’t inhale any of the toxins associated with smoking. For this reason, vaping is also healthier than smoking, because there’s no risk of inhaling tar or lighter fluid. This lack of chemicals inhaled might also be the reason why vapes pull smoother than smoking. Some vapes also allow users to control the temperature, so they can adjust if it’s too harsh. Even though these vape pens seem very simple to use, they certainly take time for users to adjust to because each battery has different features that make for an interesting high experience.

"How Smoking vs Vaping Affects Your Lungs  ● You Must See This ! !","https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Pwj6BuS8Ds","Here is what's going into your body after Vaping for a month VS Smoking Tobacco Cigarettes for a month!  There's only one thing that should be going in your lungs, and that's air!

● same experiment Smoking Just One Cigarette .... https://youtu.be/YS02MCx9f2c
● same experiment Smoking 1 Pack of Cigarettes .... https://youtu.be/AQwIDiL8gOM
● same experiment Smoking 30 Packs of Cigarettes .... https://youtu.be/HD__r66sFjk

---------- EXPLANATION of the test ------------

* The one and only reason to vape is to help get you off of smoking deadly cigarettes. 

* Anything you put in your lungs is bad for you. If you smoke deadly cigarettes, start vaping, then eventually throw away vape.

* Scientists and experts agree vaping has a 95% harm reduction over smoking. There's still that 5% of unknown harm though. That's why you shouldn't just start vaping if you don't smoke cigarettes. 

* Vaping is a cessation device (a thing to help you stop smoking) to get you off of smoking deadly cigarettes. If you don't smoke, don't vape. 

* The smoke was not held. Exhale hose clearly shown.

* if all the smoke had been blown back through the cotton, like real smoking, the results would have been even worse!

* The machine smoked/vaped each one at the same pace.  

* Each cigarette was smoked 3/4 of the way to reflect real world smoking allowing a quarter of it to just burn away while talking or thinking.

* It took 3 days for the machine to smoke all of the cigarettes and 3 days for the vape.
 
* The chamber was cleared of smoke/cloud between each and every cigarette/vape allowing air to enter. 

* Scenes were sped up and time lapsed to be able to see the visual change in colour occur.
 
* The black stuff is called tar. Heavy accumulation of tar in the hoses showed up after only 10 packs. Tar from the next 20 packs overflowed and got sucked into the pump. It eventually ruined the pump.

* Lungs DO self clean to take care of dust and debris from normal breathing in the environment.  They weren't meant to be overwhelmed on an hourly basis by smoke from a burning object for life.

* The smell inside the smoking dome at the end was vile. I felt quite ill afterwards. Can't imagine how a smoker feels on a daily basis. 

* the button for vape was held for 4-6 seconds each time. The coils did not burn. The tank was never allowed to get low to allow burning.

* People ask if I smoke or vape. I do not vape and have never smoked. 

* the average vape user vapes 60 - 120ml per month (vape company data) a total of 120ml of vape juice was vaped for this video. The average smoker smokes a pack a day. 30 packs were smoked for this video.

* the vape liquid had 6mg of nicotine

* the vapour cloud and cigarette smoke was constantly being exhaled through the exhale tube. 

* I used 2 identical vape pens and used two .5 ohm coils for the whole experiment. 

* quitting smoking is the best option.  Second best option is to vape instead of smoking then eventually throw away vaping.

* 7 million a year die from smoking cigarettes

* Both are bad, but one is way way way way less bad. Get off smokes using vape due to the fact you can adjust the nicotine level yourself slowly down to zero, then throw away vape. Story over.

* I think everyone agrees we must do our part to give kids a good start in life and do our best to prevent youngsters from taking up these very poor habits including vaping. If you are one of those people that smokes tobacco, cannabis or vapes, never let children or kids see you do it. If kids see an adult doing it, they think it's ok. If you must do it, make sure you are out of sight at home, near schools, around arenas or at parks. Do your part to help everyone raise healthy kids!

* just remember this one simple rule and you can't go wrong...."".your lungs were only meant for one thing and that's air""

▶ Ghost vs Ghost XL Disposable Vape Pen Review (Cough Warning) is a video I have wanted to do for awhile. Since vaping is so popular nowadays I would say it is appropriate to talk about them. Ghost Disposable Vape Pen and Ghost XL Disposable Vape Pen are certainly excellent ways of quitting smoking . The JUUL is an okay product and certainly does the job but in this video I will explain why the Ghost Disposable Vape Pen and Ghost XL Disposable Vape Pen are actually so much better and blows great clouds.

▶ WARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical. DO NOT VAPE if you are not the legal age in your respective country! 

▶ I can't believe how many options there are out there for Vapes. I decided to purchase the Ghost Disposable Vape Pen and Ghost XL Disposable Vape Pen to try it and compare it too other disposables like the stig. The Ghost Disposable Vape Pen and Ghost XL Disposable Vape Pen are excellent devices and actually are extremely affordable! 

▶ The vape/ e-cigarette world has revolutionized the way we intake nicotine. With this vape review I am trying to help people save money on vapes especially JUUL's which I find overpriced. Ghost Disposable Vape Pen and Ghost XL Disposable Vape Pen does the same job and is almost a quarter of the price. Vaping is continuing to grow and soon the JUUL will be obsolete. Lets help people quit smoking! 

▶The Camera I used is a ""Canon M50"" and used a basic ""amazon tripod"". For audio, I also used a ""Rode Video Micro Compact On-Camera Microphone with Rycote Lyre Shock Mount"" for my audio. I also used a ""Zoom H1n recorder"" with a ""lavalier microphone"" .I highly recommend all these for starting simple videos. For editing the video, I used a program called ""Adobe Premiere Pro"".

Scientists at UCL found that people who swapped smoking regular cigarettes for e-cigarettes or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for at least six months, had much lower levels of toxic and cancer causing substances in their body than people who continued to use conventional cigarettes. Ex-smokers who switched to e-cigarettes or NRT had significantly lower levels of toxic chemicals and carcinogen in their body compared to people who continued to smoke tobacco cigarettes. But, those who used e-cigarettes or NRT while continuing to smoke, did not show the same marked differences, highlighting that a complete switch is needed to reduce exposure to toxins.

"Is vaping less harmful than smoking? | Cancer Research UK (2021)","https://youtube.com/watch?v=-FogVhdgnBY","Studies show that levels of many harmful chemicals are much lower in people who switch from tobacco to e-cigarettes. Exposure may be similar to people who use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), such as patches or gum, and these have been shown to be safe enough to prescribe.

Some potentially dangerous chemicals have been found in e-cigarettes, but usually at levels far lower than in tobacco. As they have only become popular in recent years, we can’t yet know about the effects of long-term use.

""Smokers who picked a date to give up their addiction entirely versus those who gradually tapered off their smoking were 25 percent more likely to kick their habit, scientists from the Oxford University report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.""

Chewing tobacco: Not a safe product
http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/in-depth/chewing-tobacco/art-20047428 
""You can call chewing tobacco by whatever name you want - smokeless tobacco, spit tobacco, chew, snuff, pinch or dip - but don't call it harmless. Whether you use chewing tobacco or other types of smokeless tobacco because you like it or because you think smokeless is a safe way to use tobacco, be forewarned - chewing tobacco can cause serious health problems.""

Bacteria in smokeless tobacco products may be a health concern
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-08/asfm-bis082516.php 
""A further danger is that several species of Bacillus, as well as some Stapphylococccus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis strains can reduce nitrates to nitrites, which can potentially lead to formation of carcinogenic, tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines within the tobacco products, said Foley.""

But even before this outbreak, e-cigarettes divided the medical community. Public Health England describes e-cigarettes as ""at least 95% less harmful than tobacco cigarettes"" – a claim New York University professor David Abrams agrees with. Abrams tells ""CBS This Morning"" Tony Dokoupil why he's concerned about what the current panic about e-cigarette safety could mean for public health.

"Vaping vs Smoking vs IQOS: Which is Least Harmful?  🚬","https://youtube.com/watch?v=WJjkZOGOhjk","Vaping has become extremely popular in recent years, especially among high school students. In this video we will look at vaping vs smoking vs IQOS.

Is Vaping Really That Bad for You? 🧐

Vaping Risks - What Vaping Can Do to Your Mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btzUK1-TmrA

For those of you who don't know IQOS is the newest device for smoking cessation. It has been cleared by the FDA for sale in the United States for summer of 2019.

#IQOS uses heetsticks to heat tobacco to 350°C, without combustion or smoke. Because the tobacco is not burned, the amount of harmful chemicals are significantly reduced compared to traditional cigarettes.

FDA
The aerosol produced by the IQOS Tobacco Heating System contains fewer toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke, and many of the toxins identified are present at lower levels than in #cigarette smoke. For example, the carbon monoxide exposure from IQOS aerosol is comparable to environmental exposure, and levels of acrolein and formaldehyde are 89% to 95% and 66% to 91% lower than from combustible cigarettes, respectively.

Source: https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-sale-iqos-tobacco-heating-system-through-premarket-tobacco-product-application-pathway

As for vaping, studies conducted by the Royal College of Physicians that show that e-cigarettes available today are unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm from #smoking tobacco.

Also, there is a new study as of January 2019 conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine. The study shows that for people trying to quit tobacco, switching to e-cigarettes was nearly TWICE as effective as using other forms of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. 

Source: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1808779?query=psychiatry

The rise of teens smoking e-cigarettes has been alarming, especially because many of these kids are not using their vapes to quit smoking tobacco, they are following a trend. 

Source: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/tobacco_use/index.htm

We all know that smoking is not good for you. However, if you are trying to quit smoking cigarettes vaping or IQOS can be a much healthier option for those people. 

Warning: All of these products contain nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.

But how did this disease blow-up so fast? Is it really Vitamin E causing these cases of severe lung injury? We will discuss what is known and unknown about the effects of nicotine and THC containing e-cigarette aerosols on respiratory health, cardiovascular health, and neuro, renal and hepatic health while we are at it! Outside of this acute disease entity (EVALI), what health effects are likely to occur due to vaping?

Across the country, the use of these e-cigarettes like the popular Juul brand, is spiking among youth, but parents often aren't even sure what they are and many teens mistakenly believe there are no serious health risks.

Disclaimer: This video is about the relative benefits of legal e-cigarettes vs. smoking tobacco cigarettes. A cottage industry of unregulated, illegal and potentially dangerous products containing THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) has emerged, giving rise to alarming headlines about vaping causing potentially fatal lung disease. Virtually all such cases involve use of gray-market THC-laced liquids. PragerU's view, based on the available evidence, is that e-cigarettes are safer than tobacco cigarettes and can help people quit smoking. Ideally, we'd prefer you use neither, but if you choose to use e-cigarettes, we encourage you to use only legal products sold by reputable retailers.

Script:

Imagine if there were an alternative to smoking cigarettes.

Imagine this alternative could help millions of people quit smoking and came with only a fraction of the harmful chemicals that cigarettes do.  

Well, you don’t have to imagine it. It exists. 

E-cigarettes are the most innovative and promising smoking-cessation product yet invented. So, public health officials and anti-tobacco activists are all in favor of this life-saving innovation, right? 

Actually, they’re almost all totally against it. 

Why? 

Because, incredibly, they make no substantial distinction between e-cigarettes and real cigarettes -- even though they are completely different products. 

To begin with, e-cigarettes aren’t cigarettes. They contain no tobacco. Instead, a liquid containing nicotine derived from tobacco leaves is vaporized, and users of e-cigarettes inhale that vapor. Vapor, mind-you – not smoke. 

This is significant because the real harm from tobacco comes from the combustion process, which releases hundreds of toxic compounds known as tar. Since e-cigarettes have no tobacco and no combustion, they release no tar. This makes them, according to Britain’s Department of Health, at least 95% less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.

E-cigarettes do contain nicotine, an addictive drug. However, there is little evidence that nicotine alone is bad for you, making it similar to, say, caffeine--a drug used every day by millions of people.

Brad Rodu, an oral cancer specialist at the University of Louisville, put it this way: “I love coffee, and I’m sure I could get caffeine if I smoked my coffee beans…but I would be paying a much different price in overall health [if I did].” 

In other words, when it comes to addictive substances like caffeine or nicotine, it isn’t the addictive substance that’s harmful; it’s how it’s delivered. As South African psychiatrist Mike Russell said about cigarettes: “[People] smoke for [the] nicotine, but they die from the tar.” 

And again, there’s no tar in e-cigarettes.

Does this all mean e-cigarettes are completely safe? Of course not. Nothing is completely safe. E-cigarettes are a relatively new innovation so more research is needed, especially on long-term effects. There’s also a place for sensible regulation to ensure consumer safety.

But unlike normal everyday products, any potential risk posed by e-cigarettes is far outweighed by a real – not potential – good: saving lives by providing the nicotine that smokers enjoy without delivering the deadly toxins that can kill them. 

Many former smokers have successfully used e-cigarettes to help them kick their nicotine addiction altogether. A recent study in an Oxford Journal peer-reviewed publication, Nicotine and Tobacco Research, said that e-cigarettes could reduce smoking-related deaths by 21 percent. That’s thousands of lives every year.

Nicotine patches and all don't really work. EON Charge imitates a conventional cigarette very well. I think its a worth a try for all smokers out there who want to quit. 

EON official pages- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/planeteon/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/PlanetEON 

You can buy them here :

Also, for all those who want to try smoking, please don't. Instead, try this device. it'll keep you healthier as compared to cigarettes. They are also extremely fun to use ! 

They cost just under 500 rupees. although they are no match for conventional sub ohm vapes, I think they're a good way to get into vaping 

EON e-cigarettes don’t contain any tar, ash or stains and contains only nicotine. It also does not leave any unwanted smell in mouth and fingers. Please Note: When the LED light on the e-cigarette starts blinking, it’s time to recharge the battery.

"How To Use a Pre-Filled CBD Cartridge Vape Pen","https://youtube.com/watch?v=rUScX_Qlvq4","This is the CBD Vape Pen I use on the go for fast relief of aches and stress. People are using CBD products for a wide variety of things in regards to their health and wellness, and I get a lot of questions about this product in particular so I made a video to help! This product does not have any psychoactive effects and will not get you high. It is meant for health and wellness purposes. I even utilize this CBD vape pen for my guests on my cannabis tours who consume too much THC and they need something to balance out the intensity of the THC. Because CBD is a natural anxiety reducer, it can be really effective in conjunction with THC products to not only provide excellent pain relief, but also a wonderful calming effect should you get too high from THC products.

"Mayo Clinic Minute: Are e-cigarettes safe?","https://youtube.com/watch?v=wAsl9GY2FDo","Most health officials will tell you they believe e-cigarettes are less harmful than a conventional tobacco cigarette. But there is still plenty of uncertainty regarding the damage that e-cigarette vapor can cause to a person's body over time.
A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that mice exposed to e-cigarette vapor experienced DNA damage to certain organs that could increase the risk of cancer and heart disease.
Because there are so many unknowns and there is no scientific evidence that vaping is safe, Mayo Clinic experts urge e-cigarette users to be cautious.

A federal judge is pushing racketeering claims against the company behind Juul. The wildly popular e-cigarette manufacturer can now face charges for targeting children with its aggressive ad campaigns. Joining me to talk about this is Sara Papantonio. Sara, you know, this, this law firm, we, we initiated the tobacco lawsuit, we're, took the depositions. We got the documents. We, right in the middle of the fight. There's no difference here. This is the same. Altria, Altria that you know, used to be Phillip Morris, they're now in charge of this. This ruling now puts them on the hook, doesn't it? And that's big because Altria has limitless money. The other company, not so much. What is, what is your take? Start from the recent court ruling and tell me about it.
Absolutely. I mean, we've taken a huge step in the right direction. What the, what the judge has ultimately ruled, is there's, there's enough information to create a reasonable theory that Rico is occurring. That, that there is a criminal enterprise occurring among e-cigarette manufacturers. And what's interesting about this and what we have to understand about Rico is why it came about. And it came about to curb the mafia and the mob years and decades ago. And why were they trying to curb the mob? They're trying to curb the mob because they were distributing addictive drugs, because they were manipulating public opinion. They were buying out politicians and they were killing people. And what is happening now? We've got corporations that are distributed, addictive drugs that are buying out politicians and manipulating public opinion, and they are killing people. So it, it, it's amazing how this Rico has translated.
Well, let me make it clear. This is a civil Rico we're talking about. This judge has only ruled in civil case on Rico. But with the ruling, what it does is opens the door of possibilities to a criminal kind of conduct. So the judge is saying, okay, you've, you've, you've told me that Altria was right at the table, along with the board of directors, for the Juul company and all the other parts of the Juul company. They all work together in conjunction and they came up with a plot and the plot has potential to kill people. Now, at this point, it's a civil case, right? That doesn't mean it always stays a civil case. If, if I'm board of directors, if I'm advising these folks, I'm saying, you better get this behind you. If you can. What do we know about Juul marketing to teens? The same thing we saw in tobacco cases, what do we know about that?
What this is, e-cigarette manufacturers are trying to do is basically create a new generation of addicts because what's happened is after we popped them in the tobacco litigation, less people started, less people continued to smoke because they knew the dangers of it. So what these companies are doing now is saying, we have to create a generation of new addicts. So they're going into schools. They're talking to children at the early age of eight years old, and they're actually funneling money into these schools in order to go in there and tell them that Juuling, that e-cigarettes are actually safe. But that is the farthest thing from the truth, in this case, from what we've seen.
Well, you say, it's really insidious. They're saying to the school, we're going to give you a hundred thousand dollars, for example, if you'll let us come into your school and talk to your kids about public health and their safety.

"Is Vaping Healthier than Smoking? | OOO with Brent Rose","https://youtube.com/watch?v=PFSuRu5zZNc","Vaping is smoking's hottest new trend--just ask Leonardo DiCarpio who was caught puffing on one at the Golden Globes. The industry claims this is a safe alternative to cigarettes, but how much do we really know about the health effects of vaping? From The Vape Shop to USC's Health and Science campus, Brent Rose explores this new trend and searches for answers.

Tech writer Brent Rose is on a quest. With a surplus of emerging technologies and scientific discoveries popping up how do we separate facts from hype? Brent takes the goods out of the box—and out of the office—to find out how the new wave of cultural phenomena really holds up.

On the outside, 23-year-old Jen appears to have it all: good looks, a successful business, and a healthy 3-year-old daughter. But sadly, on the inside, Jen says she is living a nightmare and suffers from chronic anxiety. She claims that one of the main contributors is Chris, her ex-boyfriend and father of her daughter. Jen says she and Chris have a toxic relationship, and up until three weeks ago, they weren’t speaking. Additionally, Jen’s father, Steve, and Chris don’t see eye-to-eye – as Steve claims Chris never provided for his family. Chris insists he’s changed his life and wants to prove to Jen and Steve he’s the man she deserves. Today, Jen, Steve, and Chris all sit down together for the very first time in almost a year to hopefully clear the air – but, will Steve allow Chris to get a word in? Are they able to move forward and learn to co-parent? Or, is it time to move on? Tune in to find out. 19124

"The E-Cigarette Dilemma: A Public Health Perspective","https://youtube.com/watch?v=bm5qn5SF81g","Since their introduction, e-cigarettes have triggered controversy. Often touted as safer alternatives to regular cigarettes, e-cigarettes come with their own risks, including possible nicotine addiction. Use among youth in particular has increased dramatically, and the FDA has proposed tighter regulations in an effort to reduce teen use. In this Forum, experts explored the perceived risks and benefits of e-cigarettes, asking how best to move forward while preserving past tobacco control successes.

Part of The Dr. Lawrence H. and Roberta Cohn Forums, this event was presented jointly with Reuters on May 7, 2019.

"iQOS 3 Multi Unboxing! - Smoke-Free E-Cigarette","https://youtube.com/watch?v=7c6fBiK3zao","My best friend Jake(the Galaxy Tab Man: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF4t2MHsreo) in Korea has recommended me to try iQOS smoke-free e-cigarettes as he has fully quit smoking with this new type of e-cigarette that's very popular in South Korea(pretty much everyone has switched from vapor e-cigarette to this heat/vaporizing e-cigarette). While I do NOT recommend smoking in any way or form as it is bad for you, this could be potential way to stop smoking.   The iQOS 3 Multi uses real tobacco but it is heated to near the temperature of burning but not actually burned.    It's almost like smoking a real cigarette but without the smoke so I am going to give it a go and see if helps me stop/lessen smoking.  This is currently available in many countries including South Korea, Canada, UK, and more but not available in the U.S. yet officially, it should be available by next year sometime.

"Beginner Vaping - How To Vape Like A Pro, Using A Vape Pen or Vaporizer - Marijuana, Cannabis, THC","https://youtube.com/watch?v=qD5N4jQbNBQ","Have you ever wanted to learn how to vape? This quick video demonstrates all of the essentials that you'll need in order to vape like a pro.

People have smoked cannabis for centuries to enjoy its health benefits like reducing stress and stimulating appetite. But smoking releases harsh toxins that damage your lungs and can cause cancer. Plus it’s messy. And stinky.

Vaporizers heat cannabis to temperatures below burning point (451°F) which releases potent vapor with the same physical and mental benefits as smoking marijuana, but without the harsh smoke toxins1. And the herb odor is much less.

How Willy Nelson Vapes: “I’ve changed my habits a little bit. I’ve smoked so much and I got congestion from it, wheezing in the night and coughing. So I switched over to a vaporizer. You don’t get any smoke, and you don’t get any heat. And for a singer, or someone’s lungs, it’s much, much healthier. There’s pot in the vaporizer, but when you puff it in, you’re getting vapors, but not heat and not smoke. I think it’s even stronger, too.”

Four Benefits of Vaporizing
1. It's healthier than smoking — vapor contains virtually none of the harsh toxins found in smoke.
2. Works fast and is easy to control dose, unlike edible pot brownies or bread.
3. Efficient; generally you use 10–30% less herb than smoking pipes, joints or bongs.
4. Hardly any smell, only a faint herb odor that allows you to be more discreet.","Risky","Vaping tricks, Marketing"
"Tinman Electronics 8 - Disposable e-cigarette teardown","https://youtube.com/watch?v=-tLI5bKzHa4","People who use e-cigarettes may know what's inside them, but for anyone else interested in the simple anatomy of the e-cigarette, here's a quick teardown.

Apart from the mechanical assembly, disposable e-cigarette consists of a few electronic components: battery, sensor, coil. The battery undoubtedly powers the circuit, while the sensor detects when a person is puffing on the cigarette. The coil then turns on, and vaporizes the fluid in the cartridge. Optionally, there can be an indicator LED at the tip to give the impression of smoking/indicate when the cigarette is in use...for safety reasons.

For these disposable e-cigarettes, the cartridge is a propylene-glycol wick, tightly wound by the coil. Not replaceable.

And if it's a grape-flavored wick, be ready to gag when you smell your fingers after handling.

"E-Cigarettes : Welcome Back, Big Tobacco - the fifth estate","https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2myg-4zkE8","Big Tobacco is trying clean up its image, moving  into the booming e-cigarette business which continuing to peddle the deadly tobacco products.  This has left public health officials in Canada, the U.K. and the US

Five million Canadians still smoke. Could e-cigarettes help wean them over to a safer nicotine delivery device? Many ex-smokers say 'yes.' E-cigarettes are their salvation.

Health Canada is on the cusp of deciding how e-cigarettes should be regulated. Mark Kelly heads to England -- a country that has taken bold steps in embracing the e-cigarette as a safer alternative. Will Canada?  And what will this mean for our e-cigarette industry?

Until now, e-cigarettes with nicotine have not been endorsed by Health Canada. And that's kept Big Tobacco out of the Canadian market. Will new regulations open the doors for a tarred industry to join in the e-cigarette revolution?

"Why Vaping Is Bad For You","https://youtube.com/watch?v=wGJpGSCBzZ8","Health officials have reported six deaths and at least 450 cases of lung injury connected to vaping. Patients with vaping-associated lung injury display a wide array of respiratory symptoms, including coughing and chest pain. Doctors still don't know what's behind the surge in vaping-related lung injuries. They suspect it's not nicotine or THC, but other chemicals like vitamin E acetate that might be present in the vape device. People who vape are exposed to other serious health risks, beyond lung injury, doctors say. For example, nicotine, which can be present in high concentrations in e-cigarettes, is linked to brain development issues.

"Health specialist offers advice on quitting vaping","https://youtube.com/watch?v=SUmZu9Ua6dw","Many young people have taken up vaping as what they think is a safer alternative to smoking: the nicotine buzz without the cancer risks of cigarettes. But with the rash of vaping-related illnesses, many young people want to quit – and are finding it incredibly hard.

“I think the level of addiction that we’re seeing is really unprecedented in terms of the trajectory of use from initiation to dependence,” said Patricia Atwater, director of health promotion at Hall Health, the University of Washington’s student health center. “When you start using nicotine products under the age of 26, nicotine actually rewires your brain to predispose you to addiction for the rest of your life to nicotine.""

So how do people quit vaping? Cessation programs are being developed to address vaping, she said, there’s a pretty clear path in treating nicotine addiction: Replacement therapy, such as the nicotine patch, lozenge or gum.

“The best practice is to use more than one, so using both the patch and the gum,” she said.

Atwater said a big part of quitting any kind of tobacco product is addressing the role that nicotine has in your life, such as helping to manage loneliness, boredom, anxiety or stress – and then creating an environment that supports the journey of quitting.

“It is hard. It’s work. And it might be uncomfortable, but it’s worth doing,” she said.","Protective","Harmful health consequences"

"Study associates e-cigarette use with wheezing, shortness of breath","https://youtube.com/watch?v=mzh1fIutUOc","#India #Delhi #Ecigarette #Cannabis #Smoking #Cigarette #Wheezing 
Subscribe to ANI News ► https://bit.ly/2UV4ygi Don't forget to press THE BELL ICON to never miss any updates

New Delhi, May 15 (ANI): A research presented at the ATS 2021 International Conference, found that the use of e-cigarettes is associated with wheezing and shortness of breath in young adults and adolescents, even in those who do not smoke cigarettes or marijuana. They found that, after controlling for age, gender and race/ethnicity, past 30-day e-cigarette use was associated with increased odds of self-reported asthma, wheezing and shortness of breath, compared with survey respondents who reported never using e-cigarettes. This relationship held true, even after statistically controlling for those who said they had ever used cigarettes or cannabis. After controlling for past 30-day cigarette and cannabis use, past 30-day e-cigarette use was no longer associated with asthma--but was still associated with shortness of breath and increased wheezing. The prevalence of asthma, wheeze and shortness of breath was 24 per cent, 13 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. Among past 30-day e-cigarette users, 15 per cent reported using cigarettes and 37 per cent reported cannabis use. The number of adolescents and young adults who use e-cigarettes continues to increase, with estimates of 5.4 million new users in 2019. E-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product in this age group, but researchers have found it difficult to disentangle the risk of asthma and related respiratory symptoms associated with e-cigarettes due to a high frequency of cigarette and cannabis smoking among e-cigarette users age 14-21.

"Why e-cigarette ban in India will do more harm than good","https://youtube.com/watch?v=lpxDx1A5eTM","In September 2019, the Indian government banned e-cigarettes in the country citing the need to prevent potential health risks to India's youth. But is a ban the most effective tool to achieve this objective?
In this video, we examine the approaches adopted by the US and UK to discuss why a ban can often do more harm than good. 

The video is based on an article by Anupam Manur, Assistant Professor at the Takshashila Institution.

Here are some of the questions and answers.","Neutral","Harmful health consequences, Comparative health effects with smoking"
"Comparing Different Types of Ecigs and Vapes","https://youtube.com/watch?v=PxvtDGuSJR8","Types of electronic cigarettes tutorial. This video compares the different types of ecigs and vaporizers. It covers cartomizers, atomiziers, eGo ecigs (vape pens), mechanical mods (RBA), e-juice/e-liquid, and nicotine strengths.

The cigarette imitations 'cigalikes' mimic traditional tobacco cigarettes. They consist of a battery and cartomizer. Cartomizers consist of a cartridge to holds the nicotine liquid and an atomizer that vaporizes the liquid.

The eGo style ecigs (vape pens) consist of a battery and clearomizer. Clearomizers are a clear e-juice tank with an atomizer. E-juice or e-liquid is a nicotine flavored liquid. 

Mods are for the hobbyist. There are variable voltage and mechanical type mods. The battery case itself is called the mod and the e-juice tank is the RBA/RDA (rebuildable atomizer). The differences with these models are that the atomizers have to be manually assembled.","Risky","Marketing"

In this video we discuss what vaping is and address some questions related to this topic, such as the whole debate around “Is vaping better or worse than smoking? and “What does the research currently say about its health risks and the mysterious vaping-related sickness that led to dozens of deaths in 2019?”.

New Delhi, Mar 14 (ANI): In order to quit smoking, using e-cigarettes daily may help an individual, suggest the findings of a new study published by King's College London. The study also supports their effectiveness when compared to other methods of quitting, including nicotine replacement therapy or medication. Although the number of people in England who smoke has continued to fall in recent years, tobacco smoking is still the leading preventable cause of premature death and disease - killing nearly 75,000 people in England in 2019. While e-cigarettes have been around for more than a decade, evidence on their effectiveness in helping people to quit smoking is still limited. Recent studies have produced inconsistent findings or failed to measure important factors such as frequency of use or the effect of different types of e-cigarette on attempts to quit. (NK)

Smoking cigarettes can have many adverse effects on the body such as Lung damage, heart disease, infertility, risk of diabetes, risk in pregnancy, and vision problems. The ill-effects of smoking cigarettes do not only affect people who smoke. Secondhand smoke can also have significant health effects on family members, friends, and coworkers.

Vaping might appear to be a less risky choice for people who are trying to quit smoking. However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t risks involved, even if the vape liquid is nicotine-free.

The difference between smoking and vaping is that smoking delivers nicotine by burning tobacco, which can cause smoking-related illnesses, and vaping can deliver nicotine by heating a liquid in a much less harmful way.

"Vaping Risks - What Vaping Can Do to Your Mouth","https://youtube.com/watch?v=btzUK1-TmrA","Is vaping bad for you or are there any vaping risks?
Does vaping cause cancer or other e-cig related oral health issues? 
If you're an e-cigarette smoker, these are valid questions to ask yourself. 

While electronic cigarettes have been marketed as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes, recent studies cast doubt on these assertions. These studies found that e-cigarette vapors kill large numbers of cells in the mouth and cause as much damage to teeth and gums as conventional cigarettes.

The reason for this is, even though vaping products do not contain the tar and other chemicals that tobacco cigarettes contain, vaping still contains nicotine. 

Nicotine is an addictive chemical that causes a constriction of the blood vessels. 

If the blood vessels in your mouth are constricted, it makes your gum tissue much more likely to recede or get exposed to disease causing bacteria and pathogens. 

Vaping has also been shown to kill epithelial cells that line the mouth and make up the gum tissue. Killing or damaging these cells with smoking can have serious long term consequences.

Another study in the AAP News showed that Vaping among high school seniors doubled from 2017-’18.

Recent vaping also doubled for 10th-graders, from 8% to 16%, and rose from 3.5% to 6% for eighth-graders.

So if you've ever wondered if vaping is bad for you, search no further. Vaping still allows nicotine to enter the system as well as causes other health problems. 

Compared to tobacco cigarettes, vaping is most likely better for your body overall, but that does not mean that it is good for you either. Occasional, vaping most likely won't have serious long term effects. However, you should avoid owning a vape, or frequent vaping if you possibly can!

1:18 More dangers of vaping 

Is vaping actually better than smoking? In this video, we’re going to talk about the harmful effects of vaping. 

480,000 people die each year from an issue related to smoking. How many years did it take to recognize that smoking kills people? It took 50 years. Vaping has only been around since 2003, and there are no long-term studies on it. 

With vaping, you’re actually inhaling an aerosol, which is a certain gas. It’s a vaporized mist of propylene glycol and glycerin. Some of the pods that are used for vaping actually contain more nicotine than a pack of cigarettes. If a person starts to experiment with nicotine before the age of 20, the risk of addiction (to more than just smoking) goes way up. You’re also vaping from a device that has the capacity to explode. 

With flavored vaping, the chemicals are cytotoxic to your lungs. There are heavy metals, and it has the ability to impair DNA. It can also cause oxidation to the inside lining of your arteries. 


Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:

He has taught students nutrition as an adjunct professor at Howard University. He no longer practices, but focuses on health education through social media.

The agency has also confirmed six deaths because of e-cigarettes. These latest figures were released Friday. Although vaping was once advertised as a better alternative to cigarettes, VOA's Carol Pearson reports studies have increasingly been showing that e-cigarettes can be deadly.

"How to fix your leaking Vape Pen 22","https://youtube.com/watch?v=107xV3i-CE0","If you’re experiencing leaking issues with your SMOK Pen 22 in this video, we’ll show you a couple of quick and easy steps to resolve your problem.

First of all you’re going to need a fresh coil. As the Pen 22 is a sub-ohm device you’ll need to be using a high VG e-liquid. If you’re not, this could potentially be a cause of your leaking tank.

Now, you can start cleaning your kit. Empty the tank, remove the top cap, glass and coil. Discard the coil, clean and wipe down the individual parts to ensure no juice residue remains.
Once your kit has been properly cleaned, ensure the o-rings are aligned correctly (with no signs of damage). 

Install your fresh coil, ensuring it’s properly aligned. Ensure the coil is properly seated and not an angle when screwed in. Tighten the coil and ensure it is properly tightened. Be careful however not to overtighten.
After this you can fit your glass back on the kit, once again ensuring the o-rings are in place. Fit your glass straight and flush at the bottom.

Time to fill your tank. Don’t fill it up to the top, allow about 2-3 mm of space at the top. Also ensure that the e-liquid you’re using is a high VG ratio; 70 VG 30 PG for example.
Now screw your top piece back securely. Allow approx 10 mins for the e-liquid to properly saturate the cotton, and a few dry puffs will help this process.

Once you’re happy that everything is properly connected, and your coil is fully primed you can now fire up your vape.

"Is Vaping Really That Bad for You? 🧐","https://youtube.com/watch?v=jXY-A7F5y94","Is vaping bad for you, or is it a safer alternative to smoking cigarettes? 

Well, smoking any substance isn't going to be healthy for you, but there are studies conducted by the Royal College of Physicians that show that e-cigarettes available today are unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm from smoking tobacco.

Also, there is a new study as of January 2019 conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine. The study shows that for people trying to quit tobacco, switching to e-cigarettes was nearly TWICE as effective as using other forms of Nicotine Replacement Therapy.

We posted a video a while back discussing vaping risks and how e-cigarettes affect your mouth and gums. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btzUK1-TmrA

In this video we discussed some alarming studies that show that rates of #vaping in teens has almost doubled since 2018. We also covered a study that shows that the flavoring has been shown to kill epithelial cells which are cells that line the inside of the mouth. 

The rise of teens smoking e-cigarettes has been alarming, especially because many of these kids are not using their vapes to quit smoking tobacco, they are following a trend. 

We all know that smoking is not good for you. However, if you are trying to quit smoking cigarettes it can be a much healthier option for those people.

"What nicotine level should I vape?","https://youtube.com/watch?v=uqSz2ClKXMU","Text ""VeppoTube"" to 38470 for your 15% off code!

What nicotine level should you choose when vaping? 

To get the greatest enjoyment out of your vaporizer, e-cigarette or e-cigar it’s important you find the nicotine level that is just right for you. 

(Find the nicotine level that’s right for you at http://www.veppocig.com/how-to-choose-nicotine-strength) 
To select the proper nicotine level you need to ask two questions. 

1. What is your current tobacco use? 
2. What type of device are you using?

Choosing your nicotine level doesn’t have as much to do with how many cigarettes you have a day, it’s more about the kind of cigarettes you smoke. 

There is no exact level of nicotine listed on a pack of cigarettes, and that’s because some cigarettes contain more nicotine than others. 

Below the closest comparison that is available between e-liquid and cigarettes. 

Unfiltered, very strong cigarettes - 36mg of nicotine 
Full flavor and strong cigarettes - 24mg of nicotine 
Regular cigarettes - 16mg of nicotine 
Light to medium cigarettes -11mg of nicotine 
Ultra-light cigarettes - 8mg of nicotine
Super light cigarettes - 3mg of nicotine.
Non-smokers - 0mg of nicotine 

Another factor you need to take into consideration is what type of device you are using.

For disposable or rechargeable e-cigarettes and e-cigars, you can match up the nicotine level to your current tobacco use.
For more powerful devices, like those that are 10-20 watts, such as vaporizer pens, you can typically drop down one level from your nicotine level consumed from tobacco.
For the most powerful and variable devices, those that are 20+ watts, such as box mods, it’s best just to start at 3mg. 

What if it is your goal to quit nicotine altogether? 
Vaping is perfect for that. 
Start at the amount that matches your current tobacco product, and then just reduce the level gradually over time, as it feels right for you. 

Nicotine-free options allow you to continue vaping without the nicotine. 
This method has enabled many vapors to quit nicotine but still enjoy the pleasures of vaping.

Find the e-liquid nicotine level that’s right for you at VeppoCig.com.

"Don't Pack Your Vape Pen in Your Checked Luggage!","https://youtube.com/watch?v=bArnVbQVRdQ","Federal authorities are cracking down on dangerous materials on airplanes — and the latest target is the electronic cigarette. A new federal rule forbids passengers on all airlines in the U.S. from packing electronic cigarettes or other battery-operated electronic smoking devices in their checked bags to protect against in-flight fires. The Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines about the risks of e-cigarettes in checked baggage back in January. Although e-cigarettes are the target of the ban, the battery is causing the issue: Lithium cells heat the liquid nicotine to turn it into a vapor. The rule still allows e-cigarettes in carry-on bags, so travelers who use the devices have that option. However, passengers cannot recharge the devices while on the plane.

To be clear the nicotine in the vapes is the issue not the vapes themselves. Nicotine Addiction is the cause of the low back pain. Nicotine can cause back pain. Nicotine decreases blood flow to the disc spaces in the low back. Nicotine decreases nutrients to the disc spaces making them dehydrate faster leading to increased inflammation and arthritis. 

Low back pain is a side effect of vaping and nicotine addiction that you often do not hear much about. You can heal low back pain or at least manage low back pain from nicotine and vaping addiction. Step one is quitting using nicotine and quitting vaping.

"My Thoughts On Vaping + ASMR | Responding to Your Comments | Doctor Mike","https://youtube.com/watch?v=yhAyt-1VuCo","**Update** As you can probably tell I answer these questions completely relying on my knowledge and we don’t do extra takes. In the Vaping question I mistakenly said it’s Propylene Glycol that causes popcorn lung, when it is actually diacetyl (found in some flavorings). I will constantly try to improve my knowledge and give you the most honest, evidence based medicine info. Thanks for watching, love you all! 


We are back at it responding to your comments and questions via this monthly video series. I love reading and responding to your comments and as you can tell I'll jump into the comments section with a reply or a heart quite often.

A couple favorite questions/comments from this video are 

1) Why do men have nipples?

2) Why do doctors smoke?

3) What are the health effects of vaping aka what are my thoughts on vaping ?

4) What medical procedure makes me nauseous?

5) Is pimping easy?

6) Do I have doctor's handwriting?

7) Can doctors prescribe themselves medications? 

8) My thought on makeup

9) Will I ever make an ASMR video?

Doctors are traditionally unreachable and I want to change that. So hop into this video’s and any other of my video’s comment section and ask dr mike! I want to see your username pop up on my next responding to comments video. 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

"Is Vaping Safer Than Smoking? | The Deets","https://youtube.com/watch?v=iutwMFaeAgE","Traditional cigarettes and cigars are finite. You light them up, smoke them, and put them out. They also have a finite amount of nicotine.

Vaping is different. One 5% cartridge roughly has the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.

But unlike cigarettes, with vaping you aren’t ever “finished.” You can keep puffing and puffing, not realizing you may technically be getting the same amount of nicotine as you would chain-smoking.

"Can E-cigarette Regulation Protect the Public’s Health? Making Sense of the Science","https://youtube.com/watch?v=EdifNl5grLI","The burgeoning e-cigarette market has provoked deliberations about emerging e-cigarettes science, public health concerns and regulatory policy approaches. Some scientists perceive e-cigarettes as a potentially less harmful alternative to traditional tobacco products. By contrast, others fear e-cigarette use will promote tobacco consumption by “re-normalizing” tobacco use, especially among teens and young adults. The FDA plans to regulate e-cigarettes and will release rules regarding warning labels, youth access and vending machine sales sometime in the future. The World Health Organization also has weighed in, issuing strong guidelines for regulation. These steps have been applauded by some public health pundits and criticized by others. This Forum event explored aspects of the fiercely debated e-cigarette market, including marketing to youth, content of warning labels, design of products, evidence for science-based policymaking, and context of e-cigarettes within the lengthy history of tobacco use and control.

Presented April 16, 2015 in collaboration with Reuters, this event was organized with the Center for Global Tobacco Control and the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

"Vaping vs. smoking pot: What's safer, and does the high feel the same?","https://youtube.com/watch?v=aiOwvK57Jsw","Of the many ways one could consume cannabis --smoke it, eat it, vape it, dab it-- much debate swirls around the pros and cons of using a vaporizer for marijuana versus traditional smoking. 

Marijuana editor Ricardo Baca is joined on The Cannabist Show by Neos co-founder Guy Rocourt, whose company makes vape pens and electronic vaporization oil, and Starbuds dispensary owner Brian Ruden. The trio discuss whether there is science to back up the claim that vaporizing cannabis is safer than smoking flower, and if the high is the same.

"I Got Caught Vaping At School And Grounded","https://youtube.com/watch?v=2eWs_Op_Avk","By Roxy  |  Subscribe: http://bit.ly/sub2storybooth | Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated. Comment, like, share this story.

It was a few days before the last day of school and the start of summer vacation. All the kids were totally excited and pumped to be done with school and there was just a lot of crazy energy in the halls and in classes. 

Roxy met up with her best friends by the lockers and one of her friends asked her if she could bring her vape to school the next day. Of course she said yes because this was one of her best friends, and it was the end of the school year, and they were all feeling a little bit bold and defiant.

Now, the vape wasn't technically hers - she wasn't legal age (underaged) to be buying vapes or vaping - it was her older brother's juul and he was old enough. So the next morning she snuck into his room before school and grabbed his vape and hid it in her backpack. She felt weird and nervous even just having it with her, and her dad thought she was acting weird in the car on the way to school, but she kept it together.

When she got to school her friends were all there waiting for her and they want off to find a safe place to vape where they wouldn't get busted by the teachers and principal and principals or hall supervisors. But the hallways and stairwells were crowded with kids and teachers and supervisors and the only place that seemed safe and private was the girls bathroom.

So Roxy and her friend went into the girls room while their two guy friends stayed outside and sort of stood guard in front of the door. They started vaping and making thick clouds of smoke and passing it back and forth. Suddenly one of their other friends came in and wanted to know what they were doing.

It wasn't very smart of her maybe - she was really risking getting caught - and she was truly just kidding around, but Roxy blew a big cloud of vape smoke right into the girls face and started laughing. After that they left all went off to class.

Little did Roxy know that that girl who had come in to see what they were doing, and saw them vaping, immediately ran off to go snitch on her and get her caught for vaping at school. She went straight to the principal's office and reported her. 

Roxy and her friends were sitting in class when a school supervisor opened the door and whispered something to the teacher. Then the teacher called out for Roxy and she raised her hand and the supervisor came to her desk and asked her where her backpack and school things were. Roxy knew she'd been caught and was so scared, so, instead of grabbing her own backpack - she really didn't want to caught for vaping at school, didn't want to get punished or worse, suspended, grounded - she grabbed her friend's backpack instead.

The supervisor walked her to the vice principal's office who essentially told her that she had been caught vaping and that she needed to pat her down and look through her stuff. Since it wasn't really her backpack there wasn't a vape inside, but since she had accidentally grabbed a boy's bag, it became pretty obvious that it wasn't hers.

After trying to keep the lie going and failing, she finally gave up and just told the truth. She got caught vaping at school and there was nothing she could do about it. They brought her friend to the office, and her actual bag, and when the vice principal realized how they had all tried to fool her and get one over on her, she got really mad. She yelled at Roxy and told her how badly she had broken her trust.

Roxy's parents got called and her brother had to come and pick her up. She didn[t just get a referral, she got suspended from school - SUSPENDED - and then, really totally grounded for the whole summer. No phone, no friends, nothing - fully and totally grounded is almost an understatement.

She learned her lesson in a big way. Those couple of puffs of nicotine vapor cost her the entire summer, and then some. You know what her message is - vaping was not worth it!

Biobehavioral scientist Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin explains what you're actually inhaling when you vape (hint: it's definitely not water vapor) and explores the disturbing marketing tactics being used to target kids. ""Our health, the health of our children and our future generations is far too valuable to let it go up in smoke -- or even in aerosol,"" she says.

"How to Clean Vape Pen Contacts & Threads","https://youtube.com/watch?v=H8wYfgp_YkI","In this video we cover how to keep your vapor pen contacts and threads clean to prevent damage to your vaporizer.

Materials required to clean the vaporizer pen contacts:

• 91% or higher Isopropyl Alcohol (ISO)
• Cotton Swabs (aka by the brand name Q-tip)
• Small Dish or container (optional)

General Maintenance:

1 - Pour some ISO into a small dish or container to prevent contaminating the bottle of alcohol (optional).
2 - Remove the skillet heater from the battery base.
3 - Dip one end of the cotton swab into the ISO.
4 - Hold the battery base so the contact end is pointing down, this will help prevent any ISO from leaking into the base that may cause damage to the internal electronics.
5 - Using a circular motion, clean the inside thread base and battery contact.
6 - If the cotton swab come changes color, repeat the above step using clean swabs until the cotton no longer discolors. This make take several repeated cleanings to achieve.
7 - Swab around the outside threads to keep them free from residue.
8 - Clean the skillet heater the same way as the battery base holding the skillet with the contact facing down and swab inside with ISO.
9 - Let the ISO dry completely on both parts before using the pen.
